StratomeX - Clustering [Fork]
=============================

This is a fork of the original StratomeX repository to integrate dynamic, server-side clustering on
genomic data and analyze the variation / uncertainty of clustering

Features:
========
- Supports application of clustering algorithms (k-means, affinity propagation) to genomic data
- Creates views showing the distances of each patient in one cluster to the cluster centroid
- Provides separating one cluster into three different clusters to further analyze how well the divisions represent one cluster

Tasks:
=====
- Create vertical box chart with sliders for better cluster analysis
- Maybe colorize ribbons to enhance visual connections between cluster and its divisions
- Apply the data to real TCGA data
