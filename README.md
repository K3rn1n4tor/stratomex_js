StratomeX - Clustering [Fork]
=============================

This is a fork of the original StratomeX repository to integrate dynamic, server-side clustering on
genomic data and analyze the variation / uncertainty of clustering

Features:
--------
- Supports application of clustering algorithms (k-means, affinity propagation) to genomic data
- Creates views showing the distances of each patient in one cluster to the cluster centroid and the distance of each patient to all other cluster
- Provides separating one cluster into three different clusters to further analyze how well the divisions fit into one cluster
- Supports refinement of clusters / groups within a column

Future Work:
-----------
- TODO
